📝 TickTok – A Gen Z To-Do App

TickTok is a no-nonsense, aesthetically chaotic to-do list app built for the “I’ll do it later… but actually will” generation. With a sleek UI and minimal distractions, it’s made to help you stop doomscrolling and start doing.

Whether you’re in your “main character productivity era” or just trying to remember to touch grass, TickTok keeps your tasks in check—lowkey and high-impact.

✨ Features:
	•	Add, edit, and delete tasks (slay those chores)
	•	Mark tasks as done ✅ (feels good fr)
	•	Simple UI for max focus, no cap
	•	Built with C++ because we romanticize the grind

Get in, loser. We’re getting stuff done.
